# RFM Sales Analysis using SQL and Tableau
This project examines a sales dataset and generates a variety of analytics and insights based on prior purchase behavior of consumers. The RFM approach is used to go from assessing sales income to developing a customer segmentation study. The project progressed from simple SQL queries to complicated issue solving with the help of SUB QUERY, CTEs, AGGREGATE, and WINDOW functions.
